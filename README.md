## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Specification

I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### What do I do from here?

1. Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**.
2. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository
3. Open Terminal.
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type `git clone`, and paste the URL you copied, and then press enter.
6. Go to the downloaded file in your terminal, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer as follows:

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
    * If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
    * If you have Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
    * If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

7. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
